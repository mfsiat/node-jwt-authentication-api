# Node JWT Authentication

> Authenticate with JWT token

## Why use JWT web tokens

These tokens are used to protect routes in an API, so that we can add
authentication to fetch a token and then we can make access to that token to get access to protected routes. If we have **node** on backend and **react** on front end we can make request to login and get the login stuff, thus we can get a token which can be saved anywhere and by that token we can get the protected stuffs that we need.
